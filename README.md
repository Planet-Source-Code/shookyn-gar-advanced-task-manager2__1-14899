### Description

This is a Task Manager / viewer which shows all currently running procceses, and all open

windows, as well as CPU usage. you can also force windows(not processes) to close.

It also had a listing option which creates a text report of all currently running apps and windows, this is good for Spy apps and stuff.

This is a fixed version of this app, if it still won't work on your pc, erase all the CPU

usage code which seems to cause trouble on some versions of windows.
